-Believer-
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
First things first
Can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start with from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather
Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without hurt
Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without game
I know that glory don't come without...
Don't come without...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of fire and flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer


-Bad liar-
Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don't prey on
Innocent victims
Trust me, darling, trust me darling
It's been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears
Integrity, faith and
Crocodile tears
Trust me, darling, trust me, darling
So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape
I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go (go)
Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I've been askin'
Oh, I've been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war, on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darling)
Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darling)
Problems, problems, problems
So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape
I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
That I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go
I can't breathe, I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be
Believe me, this one time
Believe me
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
That I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go
Oh
Please believe me
Please believe me


-Thunder-
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes-sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the back seat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nosebleeds

Thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder
(Never give up on your dreams)
Thunder, feel the thunder
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder
(Never give up on your dreams)

Thunder, thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

-Demons-
When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood's run stale
I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside
There's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
At the curtain's call
It's the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you've made
Don't wanna let you down
But I am hellbound
Though this is all for you
Don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright
I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide


-Radioactive-
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
I raise my flags, don my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We'll paint it red to fit right in
Whoa
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow

Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive


-Whatever it takes-
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling, it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes


-Natural-
Will you hold the line
When every one of them is giving up or giving in? Tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will Heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a
Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural
Will somebody
Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing?
What's happening?
Looking through the glass find the wrong within the past knowing
Oh, we are the youth
Cut until it bleeds, inside a world without the peace facing
A bit of the truth, the truth
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a
Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural
Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold

Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion (yeah)
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure (ooh, yeah)

Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety (anxiety)
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feelin' the world go against us (against us)
So we put the world on our shoulders
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
Ooh

Uh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dyin' slow but the devil tryna rush me
See I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eatin' peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm comin' to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from a plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain
Used to doin' bad, now we feel like we just now gettin' it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never goin' slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord, have mercy on the witnesses
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain
More pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'

For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin'


-Warriors-
As a child you would wait
And watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play
In youth you'd lay
Awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream!
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust.
Will come
When you'll have to rise
Above the best and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies!
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above
But don't weep for me
'Cause this will be
The labor of my love
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town

-It's time-
So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit, right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the Academy a rain check
I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check
I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am
This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes
To ashes
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand

-I bet my life-
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
I've been around the world and never in my wildest dreams
Would I come running home to you
I've told a million lies but now I tell a single truth
There's you in everything I do
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I've played
Please forgive me for all I've done
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life for you
I, I bet my, I bet my, I bet my
I, I bet my, I bet my, I bet my


-Next to me-
Something about the way that you walked into my living room
Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am
But still you, still you want me
Stress lines and cigarettes, politics and deficits
Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'
But still you, still you want me
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still I find you
Next to me (next to me)
There's something about the way that you always see the pretty view
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless
And still you, still you want me
I got no innocence, faith ain't no privilege
I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts
And still you, still you want me
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still I find you
Next to me
So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it (oh)
So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it (oh)
Oh, I always let you down (I always let you down)
You're shattered on the ground (shattered on the ground)
But still I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do (stupid things I do)
I'm far from good, it's true
But still I find you
Next to me (next to me)


-Walking the wire-
Do you feel the same when I'm away from you?
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you?
We could turn around, or we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes
Oh, the storm is raging against us now
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down
But we took the step, and we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes
Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here
We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We're gonna be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire
There's nights we had that just walk away
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade
It's the price we pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes
Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here
We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We're gonna be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walking the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below
Oh, I'll take your hand when thunder roars
And I'll hold you close, I'll stay the course
I promise you from up above
That we'll take what comes, take what comes, love
We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We're gonna be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walking the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below
We're walking the wire
We're walking the wire
We're walking the wire, wire, wire


-Not today-
There she goes in front of me
Take my life and set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road is at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it
We finally fall apart and we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love, we better start today
It's gotta get easier, oh easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh easier and easier somehow
Oh I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over, unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
But not today
Not today
There she goes in front of me
Take my life, set me free again

-who we are-
Up in the morning,
Up in the evening,
Picking down talks when the birds get back to me.
Oh, to me.
Up on the mountain,
Down in the king's lair,
Pushing these boxes in the heat of the afternoon.
Oh, afternoon.
We were never welcome here,
We were never welcome here at all.
No.
It's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.
Save us,
What we are,
Don't look clear,
It's all uphill from here.
Ooh.
Up in the attic,
Down in the cellar,
Lost in a static,
Coming back for more.
Oh, for more.
Out with the reason,
In with the season,
Taking down names in my book of jealousy.
Jealousy.
We were never welcome here.
We were never welcome here at all.
No.
It's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.
Because it's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.
Save us,
What we are,
Don't look clear,
It's all uphill from here.
Ooh.
They say we're crazy.
They say we're crazy.
They say we're crazy.
They say we're crazy.
They say we're crazy.
They say we're crazy.
They say we're crazy.
They say we're, crazy.
It's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.
Because it's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.
Why won't you save us,
What we are,
Don't look clear,
It's all uphill from here.
Ooh.


-Zero-
I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
Twenty-seven years and the end of my mind, but
Holding to the thought of another time, but
Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't want to hear about what to do
I don't want to do it just to do it for you
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out
I find it hard to tell you how I want to run away
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down, semi never demigod
I remember walking in the heat of the summer
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
Twenty-seven years and I've nothing to show
Falling from the doves to the dark of the crow
Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't want to hear about what to do, no
I don't want to do it just to do it for you
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Let me tell you 'bout it
Well let me tell you 'bout it
Maybe you're the same as me
Let me tell you 'bout it
Well let me tell you 'bout it
They say the truth will set you free
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero

-Monster:Imagine dragons-
Ever since I could remember
Everything inside of me
Just wanted to fit in (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I was never one for pretenders
Everything I tried to be
Just wouldn't settle in (oh, oh, oh, oh)
If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seem dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
If this problem lies in me
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger
Can I clear my conscience
If I'm different from the rest
Do I have to run and hide? (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I never said that I want this
This burden came to me
And it's made it's home inside (oh, oh, oh, oh)
If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seem dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
If this problem lies in me
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger


-Bleeding out-
I'm bleeding out
Said if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bear my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)
When the day has come
But I've lost my way around
And the seasons stop and hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns gray
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating
You tell me to hold on
Oh you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong
'Cause I'm bleeding out
Said if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bear my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)
When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To feel they're not worth hollering
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow
You tell me to hold on
Oh you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong
'Cause I'm bleeding out
Said if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bear my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)
I'm bleeding out for you
'Cause I'm bleeding out
Said if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bear my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)


-Battle cry-
Just one more time before I go
I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now
Stars are only visible in darkness
Fear is ever-changing and evolving
And I, I feel poison inside
And I, I feel so alive
Nobody can save you now
King is crown, it's do or die
Nobody can save you now
The only sound
It's the battle cry
It's the battle cry
It's the battle cry
Nobody can save you now
It's do or die
Nobody can save you now
King is crown, it's do or die
Nobody can save you now
The only sound
It's the battle cry
It's the battle cry
It's the battle cry
Nobody can save you now
It's do or die
Just one more time before I go
I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now


-I don't know why-
We could be strangers in the night
We could be passing in the shadows
We couldn't be closer if we tried
When we're caught in the headlights
We could be faces in the crowd
We could be passing in the shadows
Upping the risk of being found
When we're caught in the headlights
Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lying trust
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I was a faking alibi
Trading the truth in for a lie, oh
We were the essence of desire
And we're caught in the headlights
Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lying trust
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you (I don't know why)

To do with you (I don't know why)
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
That you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me (dangerous)
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me (your love is always dangerous)
Tell me that you love me

I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know why)
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you (do with, do with, do with)
To do with you (I don't know why)
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know why)
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you


-Friction-
Get down with the victim
We both know you need them
You're stuck in the middle
Of all irrelevance
And your heart is beating
'Cause you know that you gotta
Get out of the middle
And rise to the top now
When you've made it
Won't ya tell me what to do
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong
When you made it, when you made it

So ease it off
Can't take the pressure
So ease it off

And get into the system
We both know you need one

Is taking over you
And your heart is beating

Get out of the middle

Don't tell me to be strong
Ease it off
You can't fight the friction
So yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah


-Shots-
Am I out of touch?
Am I out of my place?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space
Oh, I'm wishing you're here
But I'm wishing you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm going to mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
In the meantime we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
I'm sorry for everything
Oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved
Am I out of luck?
Am I waiting to break?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for a way to escape
Oh, I'm wishing I had what I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm going to mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
In the meantime we let it go

With our backs to the wall
The darkness will fall
We never quite thought
We could lose it all
Ready aim fire
Ready aim fire
An empire is falling
In just one day
You close your eyes
And the glory fades
Ready aim fire
Ready aim fire away

Off in the distance
There is resistance
Bubbling up and festering
Hey mr motion
Make me a potion
Shake it all up
With your mistery
How come I've never seen
Your face around here
I know every single face
Around here
A man on a mission
Changing the vision
I was never welcome here
We don't have the choice to stay
We'd rather die than
Do it your way
With our backs to the wall
The darkness will fall

Shaking and pacing
This is the tunnels life
Blood in the writting
Stuck in the fighting
Look through the riffle's sight
How come I've never seen
Your face around here
I know every single face
Around here
Hearing the echo
Holding the shackle
I was never welcome here
We don't have the choice to stay
We'd rather die than
Do it your way

The darkness will fall
We never quite thought

Took your heart, took your hand
Promised you all that I had
Hoping that you understand
I'm far from a perfect man

Baby I know it's not fair
Lay with me, for one more night
I promise you, I'll make it right
I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night, I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night, I'll make it up to you
I know you don't understand
the vices that follow a man
And in your eyes I can see
the places that you'd rather be

In my darkest hour, in the dead of the night I'll make it up to you
Your hands are mine, I'll make it up to you
Promises are nothing more than fleeting thoughts
But you, you are my life babe

On the mouth of the river
On the mouth of the river
Oh the mouth of the river
I want to live a life like that
Live the life of the faithful one
Wanna bow to the floor
With everybody else want to be someone
I want to make some love
I don't want no enemies
It's the curse of a man
Always living life, living live, living just to please
On the mouth of the river
And the wrath of the giver
With the hands of a sinner
On the mouth of the river (woah)
On the mouth of the river (woah)
And the wrath of the giver (woah)
With the hands of a sinner (woah)
On the mouth of the river
Oh I'm alkaline
I'm always keeping the basics
I'm overboard
I'm self-destructive and self-important
And I'm anxious
Oh I'm self-assured
I'm nervous and I'm pacing, oh I'm pacing
On the mouth of the river
And the wrath of the giver
With the hands of a sinner
On the mouth of the river (woah)
On the mouth of the river (woah)
And the wrath of the giver (woah)
With the hands of a sinner (woah)
On the mouth of the river
On the mouth of the river
On the mouth of the river
And I am going under
Oh I am going under
I am going under
Oh I am going under
I am going under
Oh I
On the mouth of the river
And the wrath of the giver
With the hands of a sinner
On the mouth of the river (woah)
On the mouth of the river (woah)
And the wrath of the giver (woah)
With the hands of a sinner (woah)
On the mouth of the river
On the mouth of the river
On the mouth of the river


-Rise up-
I was hoping for an indication
I was seeking higher elevation
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
I've been shaken wakin' in the night light
I've been breakin' hiding from the spotlight
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
The more I stray the less I fear
And the more I reach the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh it's calling out and I won't walk away
I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for the making changes
Walking down the street and meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)
Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
I was there but I was always leaving
I believe it, that I was never breathing
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
The more I stray the less I fear
And the more I reach the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh it's calling out and I won't walk away
I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for the making changes
Walking down the street and meeting strangers
Flipping through my life, turning pages (rise, rise up)
I'm bursting like the 4th of July
So color me and blow me away
I'm broken in the prime of my life
So embrace it and leave me to stray
I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for the making changes
Walking down the street and meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)
I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for the making changes
Walking down the street and meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)


-Bullet in a gun-
The Roman king, the Romulus
The precipice, born to change
The final days, the last appraise
Augustus, Nero, taking names
I'm high, then I'm low, low
Stop, then I go, go
Bipolar, oh, oh
Yes, then I'm no, no
My time will come, I promise that
Pull the trigger back, back
Bullet in a gun (hey)
But in the end, my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun
Blood, sweat and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun (hey), gun (hey), gun (hey)
Gun (hey), gun (hey), gun (hey), gun (hey)
Bullet in a gun (bu bu, hey), gun (hey), gun (bu bu, hey)
Gun (hey), gun (bu bu, hey), gun (hey), gun (bu bu, hey)
Bullet in a gun
To make a name, you pay the price
You give your life, no other way
The devil's deal, it comes around
To wear the crown, rise up from the ground
I'm high, then I'm low, low
Stop, then I go, go
Bipolar, oh, oh
Yes, then I'm no, no
My time will come, I promise that
Pull the trigger back, back
Bullet in a gun (hey)
But in the end, my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun
Blood, sweat and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun (hey), gun (hey), gun (hey)
Gun (hey), gun (hey), gun (hey), gun (hey)
Bullet in a gun (bu bu, hey), gun (hey), gun (bu bu, hey)
Gun (hey), gun (bu bu, hey), gun (hey), gun (bu bu, hey)
Bullet in a gun
How many voices go unheard?
How many lessons never learned?
How many artists fear the light
Fear the pain, go insane?
Lose the mind, lose the self
(You only care about fame and wealth)
Sellout, sellout, sellout
Bullet in a gun (hey)
But in the end, my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun
Blood, sweat and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun (hey), gun (hey), gun (hey)
Gun (hey), gun (hey), gun (hey), gun (hey)
Bullet in a gun (bu bu, hey), gun (hey), gun (bu bu, hey)
Gun (hey), gun (bu bu, hey), gun (hey), gun (bu bu, hey)
Bullet in a
