Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl quit playin'
We're just friends, what are you sayin'
Said there's another, look right in my eyes
My first love, broke my heart for the first time
And I was like baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Oh for you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool
But I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything
I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me, 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm goin' down, down, down, down
And I can't just believe my first love won't be around
And I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no

Luda, when I was thirteen, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily
Don't need no Starbucks (woo)
She made my heart pound
And skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground
But I really wanna see her on the weekend
She know she got me dazin'
'Cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin'
But I just keep on sayin'
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh

-HOLY-
I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river, uh
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
And no, I can't stand it bein' fake
No, no, no, no, no, no-no-no
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say, "Fools rush in"
But I don't know (ah-ah, ah, ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say, "Fools rush in"
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper, ah)
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty, like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a jet-ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you
Bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud
If you make it to the water He'll part the clouds
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up
Formalize the union in communion He can trust
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us
I know we believe in God and I know God believes in us
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy


-LOVE YOURSELF-
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
When you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby, I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself (yeah)
And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm)
Still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself


-I DON'T CARE-
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" Hell, yeah
You know I love you, did I ever tell you?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, yeah
I always feel like I'm nobody, mm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah

I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm supposed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
And you make it better like that
Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mm
But now I think that we should stay
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear

Do you think of me
When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin'
Everything, I wanna know it all
I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you

-SORRY-
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missin' more than just your body

-NEVER SAY NEVER-
Never say never
(Never, never)
Yeah, yeah
See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny
I will never say never! (I will fight)
I will fight till forever! (Make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Ne-never say never (never)
Ne-never say never (never)
Ne-never say never (never)

I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny
I will never say never! (I will fight)
I will fight till forever! (Make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up

Here we go!
Guess who?
Jsmith and JB! (Uh-huh!)
I gotcha little bro
I can handle him
Hold up, aight?
I can handle him
Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me!
I be trying to chill
They be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood
I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the flyest
Like David and Goliath
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land (I'm gone!)
I will never say never (never say it, never, never say it) I will fight
I will fight till forever (okay, okay) to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Say never (never say it, never say it)
Say never (okay, okay)
Whenever you knock me down

Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up,

Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Man now we stepping out like whoa (oh God)
Camera's point and shoot,
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you, you
You the one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered,
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side,
It's green where you water it

Mi amor started slow, got faster

Feels so good damn, and I don't know why
I'm addicted, something like an addict
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it
Explosive, explosive (I could still smell her perfume)
It's not hard to notice, that I'm open

Tattoos, piercings and she just learned to twerk
She ain't got a heart or a ass, just her brains, gotta ask
'Cause her ass on a learning curve
And she love to earn the verb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctors note
Real deep pockets like a doctors coat
Stay fitted like Diddy, hair back tryna rock the boat
She the first mate wanna rock the boat
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
It goes, it goes her, blank, blank, and rock and roll

Thots twerk for the goodfella

-FOREVER-
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't better, better, better

Turn me back like whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushing a Monte Carlo?
Bet that money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh no
See them heat waves in the desert look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me
Keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me
Made me aware of what I was missing
Been missing the way you give me ambition, babe
Never thought I'd settle down
Reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusing on being by myself
Set my feelings to the side they all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothing left
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around
Turn me back like whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
When you asked me if I cheated, I said never (no way)
What are you willing to do to stay together? (Together)
How many times we gonna break up for the summer?
How many times you gonna try to call my mother?
Girl, you killin' me
I don't wanna act like I can fix this (fix it, fix it)
I don't wanna be the one that's changed since Texas
Currency, it comes so naturally
But I can't buy your love
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around
Turn me back like whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Wake up, your face in my chest
Your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
Counting the stars with our last name on the license plate
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave, it's bye for now, it's just never bye for long
Set my feelings aside
Let's settle down
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around
Turn me back like whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
Won't you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Won't you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around


-HABITUAL-
Flowers open when they feel the sunlight
Moon rise, tide change right before our eyes
Aggressive but softly, you place your lips on my lips
We're each others vice
Our feelings go deep, deeper than the touching
Deeper than the ocean, so we ain't never rushing through
Our days, or our nights, ain't no repercussions
Never get enough I'm only for your consumption
Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to, be stable
Earth keeps spinning around, we're breathing
So thankful
My love for you's habitual, yeah (habitual, yeah)
Not for a moment, but forever
Know it sounds untraditional, yeah
Never ungrateful for it
That's how we both want it
Habitual
Can't nobody keep me like you
Call it unconventional (call it unconventional)
Our love is habitual, yeah (habitual, yeah)
Just to think that we've been out here, this whole time
Working through the seasons
Never cross paths, 'til we had a reason
Now let's fast forward, look up a whole new perspective for life
Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to be stable
Earth keeps spinning around
We're breathing
So thankful
My love for you's habitual, yeah (so habitual)
Not for a moment, but forever
Know it sounds untraditional, yeah (no)
Never ungrateful for it (never ungrateful)
That's how we both want it
Habitual (ooh)
Can't nobody (oh) keep me like you (keep me like you)
Call it unconventional (call it unconventional)
Our love is habitual, yeah (our love is habitual)


-ETA-
Feels like time's moving in slow motion
Just trying to occupy my mind
So that I don't go loony over you (ooh-ooh)
Just trying to amplify the sound
To drown out all of this need for you (you-ooh-ooh)
Biting my nails got me nervous
So anxious, see it's one o'clock now
Noon felt like three hours ago
I just wanna know your E.T.A
E.T.A., out the window got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another, be honest
What's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?
Say you almost right here now
Just say you pulling up to my gate
Don't say the signal faded driving through the canyon
Just hurry up for my sake
I was born ready for you
Skin sweeter than cinnamon
Eyes deeper than the ocean
Love me hard like where you been
Love me like you don't want it to end
I just wanna know your E.T.A
E.T.A., out the window got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another, be honest
What's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?
Before you gotta go (oh-ooh-oh-oh)
Before you gotta go
Drop a pin for me now
So I can learn your location
Thank you, yes, your less than five minutes away from me
In your arms, rubbing on your face
Only place I wanna be
In the bed, where we lay our head
Only place I wanna be


-I'LL SHOW YOU-
My life is a movie and everyone's watching
So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting
'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I've got to learn things, learn them the hard way
Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting
'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you


-SOMEBODY TO LOVE-
Oh, oh, for you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin
"It's time to sink or swim"
Watch 'em play for ya
For you I'd be, whoa, oh
Running a thousand miles
Just to get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot but for you I admit I'd
Rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one
Givin' you all this attention, baby, listen
I just need somebody to love
I, I don't need too much
Just need somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear

I need somebody, I, I need somebody
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
Everyday, I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds
Smile for me (smile for me)
I would take, every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime, step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot but for you I admit I'd
Rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one
Givin' you all this attention, baby, listen
I just need somebody to love

I just need somebody to love
And you can have it all, anything you want
I can bring you, give you the finer things, yeah
But what I really want, I can't find, 'cause
Money can't find me somebody to love, oh
Find me somebody to love, oh
I need somebody to love, yeah, I, I don't need too much
Just somebody to love, somebody to love
I don't need nothing else
I promise, girl, I swear, I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I, I need somebody

Is she out there? Is she out there? Is she out there?
Is she out there?
I just need somebody to love


-ALL THAT MATTERS-
Oh, oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to shine in my life
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long long time
Better believe it
Oh, oh, whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
'Til you're back again, oh yeah, yeah
You think I'm biased
To my significant other
You hit it right on the head
Only been missing my lover
Got a whole lotta texts in my phone and I don't reply
The next eight bars tell you why
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I'm not myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
What's a king bed without a queen
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
Take the gas out the car it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you, and only you
Oh, oh, grateful for your existence
Faithful, no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I'm not myself

Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
