-Lose you to love me-
You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off key in my chorus
'Cause it wasn't yours
I saw the signs and I ignored it
Rose colored glasses all distorted
Set fire to my purpose
And I let it burn
You got off on the hurtin'
When it wasn't yours, yeah
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dance, it was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me
I gave my all and they all know it
Then you tore me down and now it's showing
In two months, you replaced us
Like it was easy
Made me think I deserved it
In the thick of healing, yeah
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dance, it was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me
You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off key in my chorus
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
And now the chapter is closed and done
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us


-Wolves-
In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love and one to lose
Sweet divide, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night (night)
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you (oh to get to you)
Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly I am following
Break down these walls and come on in
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you (oh to get to you)
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you (oh to get to you)


-Same old love-
Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh, (that same old love)
Oh, (that same old love)
I'm so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I'm so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh, (that same old love)
Oh, (that same old love)
I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
'Cause I won't be changing too, you know
You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh, (that same old love)
Oh, (that same old love)
I'm so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I'm so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh, (that same old love)
Oh, (that same old love)
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh, (that same old love)
Oh, (that same old love)
I'm so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I'm so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh, (that same old love)
Oh, (that same old love)


-It ain't me-
It ain't me
It ain't me
It ain't me
I had a dream
We were sipping whiskey neat
Highest floor of The Bowery
Nowhere's high enough
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough
No, I don't wanna know
Where you've been or where you're going
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you when the Sun won't let you sleep?
It ain't me
Na, na, in The Bowery
Na, na, and the whiskey neat
Where go, are you going?
Where go?
It ain't me!
Na, na, in The Bowery
Na, na, and the whiskey neat
Where go, are you going?
Where go?
It ain't me!
Na, na, in The Bowery
Na, na, and the whiskey neat
Where go, are you going?
Where go?
It ain't me!


-The heart want what it wants-
You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Hell over trip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no I can't escape
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
This is a modern fairy tale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants


-Back to you-
Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you
(Feeling about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (even though I do)
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
We never got it right
Playing and replaying old conversations
Overthinking every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me ('cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hiding?
Everybody knows we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
What was there wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are running loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you)
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)

-Good for you-
I'm on my fourteen carats
I'm fourteen carat
Doing it up like Midas
Now you say I got a touch
So good, so good
Make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't
Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating
'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you
I'm on my marquise diamonds
I'm a marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave
I won't, I won't
Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to how you're breathing
'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you
Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I
Hold on, take a minute, love
'Cause I ain't trying to mess your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to mess your fitness up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, the signature
Any time I hit it, know she feelin' for it through
And any time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next chick
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad miss without the ass shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I


-Kill em with kindness-
The world can be a nasty place
You know it, I know it, yeah

Put down the weapons you fight with
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now
We're running out of time
Chasing our lies
Everyday a small piece of you dies
Always somebody
You're willing to fight, to be right
Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
And no war and anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you're fighting
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now
Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
No war and anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting

Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness

-Hands to myself-
Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
Your metaphorical gin and juice
So come on, give me a taste
Of what it's like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
Your metaphorical gin and juice
Oh, cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying
But I...
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself

The doctors say you're no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day
Oh, cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying
But I...

My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself

I mean, I could but why would I want to?
My hands to myself

-Fetish-
Take it or leave it
Baby take it or leave it
But I know you won't leave it
'Cause I know that you need it
Unh, look in the mirror
When I look in the mirror
Baby I see it clearer
Why you wanna be nearer
I'm not surprised
I sympathize, ah
I can't deny
Your appetite, ah

'Cause they sayin' we already did it
Call on Gucci if you ever need and
I'll be South Beach in the drop top gleamin'
Water diamonds, Aquafina
Just need you in a blue bikini
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back

-Rare-
Baby, you've been so distant from me lately
And lately don't even want to call you "baby"
Saw us getting older
Burning toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high
Waiting up for you upstairs
Why you act like I'm not there?
Baby, right now it feels like
It feels like you don't care
Oh, why don't you recognize I'm so rare?
Always there
You don't do the same for me
That's not fair

-Boy friend-
I want a boyfriend
But I just keep hitting dead ends

Pretty restlessly
Think I might know why (ah)
I've been doing just fine
But baby, that don't mean

There's a difference between a want and a need
Some nights I just want more than me
I know that there's a fine line between
It's not what I need, but (yeah)

No one love you like I love ya
Never cheat, never lie
Never put no one above ya
I gave you space and time
And now you're telling me you miss it
And I'm still on your mind
We were one in a million
And love is hard to find
Do you stay up late, just so you don't dream?
Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me
Every time you dance with somebody
I want you to feel me

Heartbeat a little bit louder?

When you're running, who you run to?
Where do you go to hide?
When she ain't giving you enough to get you through the night
Won't be caught up in the middle
Of your highs and your lows
Baby, 'long as you're not with me, you'll always be alone
Do you stay up late, just so you don't dream?
Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me

-Souvenir-
New York back in August, tenth floor balcony
Smoke is floating over Jane and Greenwich street
Goosebumps from your wild eyes when they're watchin' me
Shivers dance down my spine, head down to my feet
Swimming in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
Egyptian blue
Something I've never had without you
You're giving me chills at a hundred degrees
It's better than pills how you put me to sleep
Calling your name, the only language I can speak
Taking my breath, a souvenir that you can keep
Giving me chills
Chills
Sunset Tower lobby, waiting there for me
In the elevator, fumble for your key
Kissed in every corner, Presidential Suite
Opened up Bordeaux from 1993
Swimming in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
Egyptian blue
Something I've never had without you
You're giving me chills at a hundred degrees
It's better than pills how you put me to sleep
Calling your name, the only language I can speak
Taking my breath, a souvenir that you can keep
Giving me chills
Take my, take-take my breath away, just like
Take my breath away, just like a souvenir
Take my, take-take my breath away, just like
Take my breath away, just like a souvenir
You're giving me chills at a hundred degrees
It's better than pills how you put me to sleep
Calling your name, the only language I can speak
Taking my breath, a souvenir that you can keep
Giving me chills
Take my, take-take my breath away, just like
Take my breath away, just like a souvenir
Giving me chills
Take my, take-take my breath away, just like
Take my breath away, just like a souvenir

-Bad liar-
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Ohh, tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooh every time I watch you serpentine
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no
Not to give in to you
With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar
I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?
Paint my kiss across your chest
If you're the art, I'll be the brush
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooh every time I watch you serpentine
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

-Past life-
I'm trying to be honest with my happiness
Don't know why I'm bad at this, uh
And I don't wanna sit in all my sadness
I know it's a habit of mine
Perfect, perfect timing
I start what I don't know how to end
Don't re-, don't remind me
I ruined it before it began, oh
Last night was the last night of my past life
Got me here like you could never figure me out
Last night was the last time, was the last time
I never let you figure me out
Sitting here, talking to myself
Thinking how I used to use you
Only thing I'm used to
Last night was the last time, was the last time, woah
Gave me what I wanted when I needed it
Honestly, I mean it
And if I could convince myself to feel it
You know I would feel it, I would
Perfect, perfect timing
I start what I don't know how to end…


-She-
She was too young to be the Hollywood type
Too pure to understand the lows and the highs
She didn't know if she was gonna survive
It all got so much better with time
All of the evil eyes
Tequila before sunrise
I'd tell her to watch her back
That she's worth more than that
'Cause she was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons
Wish I could tell her
She was a girl with good intentions
Didn't need the second guessing
Didn't need to ever question
Wish I could tell her
She didn't know all of the hurt she could take
Her world was crumbling and so was her faith
Wish I could talk to her, 'cause what I would say
"Oh baby, you're enough to get you out of this place"
All of the flashing lights
Tequila before sunrise
I'd tell her to watch her back
That she's worth more than that
But she was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons
Wish I could tell her

I know you'll have a choice before it gets too dark
(Ah)
I know you'll get the chance to find who you are
I know you'll have the choice
She was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons
Wish I could tell her

-Vulnerable-
If I gave you every piece of me, I know that you could drop it
Give you the chance, I know that you could take advantage once you got it
If I open up my heart to you, I know that you could lock it
Throw away the key and keep it there forever in your pocket
If I gave the opportunity to you, then would you blow it?
If I was the greatest thing that happened to you, would you know it?
If my love was like a flower, would you plant it, would you grow it?
I might give you all my body, are you strong enough to hold it?
If I show you all my demons
And we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets
Wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable
If I hand you my emotions, would you even want to take it?
(Would you even want to take it? Yeah)
If I give you all my trust, then would you fumble it and break it?
(Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm)
If I let you cross my finish line, then would you wanna make it?
(Would you wanna make it? Would you wanna make it?)
I think I'm ready, won't you come and flip the switch and activate it?
(Ooh)
If I show you all my demons
And we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets

-A sweeter place-
Yeah, yeah-ah
Yeah, yeah-ah, ah
Is there a place where I can hide away?
Red lips, French-kiss my worries all away
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugarcoat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter
Ooh, you'll really wanna know where I've been all this time
So let me tell ya
Ooh, got two feet on the ground and felt what real is like
What it was like
Living out of the scene, out in the wild
Learning to breathe up in the clouds, far from the crowds
I can't believe, I can be loud
Holding hands with the darkness
And knowing my heart is allowed, allowed
Is there a place where I can hide away?
Red lips, French-kiss my worries all away
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugarcoat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter
As I fantasize
So much to see, I'm in paradise
Oh I, always seems I'm new inside
Deep, deep down in me, I lift up, baby, born to fly
Oh I, now, see, how could it be
We will find our way, we'll find the things we seek
Ooh we, you see I'm mesmerized
Place is just for me and I am cutting ties
Goodbye (hmmm)
Is there a place where I can hide away? (Hide away)
Red lips, French-kiss my worries all away (all away)
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugarcoat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter
Have no fear (no fear)
Heaven is near (close by)
Oh whoa, head is so clear (so clear)
A sweeter place, my sweeter place
Have no fear (no fear)
Heaven is near (close by)
Oh whoa, head is so clear (so clear)
My sweeter place, my sweeter place

-Fly to your heart-
Watch all the flowers
Dance with the wind
Listen to snowflakes
Whisper your name
Feel all the wonder lifting your dreams
You can fly
Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
When you believe you'll find your wings
Fly to your heart
Touch every rainbow
Painting the sky
Look at the magic
Glide through your life
A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night
You can fly
Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
When you believe you'll find your wings, fly
Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings
Fly, you can fly to your heart
Rise to the heights of all you can be
Soar on the hope of marvelous things
Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
When you believe you'll find your wings
Fly
Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings
Fly, you can fly to your heart

-Love will remember-
Now's all we got and time can't be bought.
I know it inside my heart forever will forever be ours.
Even if we try to forget, love will remember.
You said you love me, I said I loved you back
What happened to that, what happened to that
All your promises, and all them plans we had,
What happened to that, what happened to that
Boom gone, yeah we move on, even if we try to forget,
Love will remember you, love will remember me
I know it inside of my heart,
Forever will forever be ours, even if we try to forget,
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember, love will remember
The trips we dreamed of taking the tacks left on the map,
What happened to that, what happened to that
When all you had was nothing, and all we did was laugh
What happened to that, what happened, what happened to that
Boom gone, yeah we move on, even if we try to forget
Love will remember you, love will remember me
I know it inside of my heart,
Forever will forever be ours, even if we try to forget,
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember, love will remember
Break down the walls let heaven in, somewhere and forever we'll dance again,
We used to be inseparable, I used to think that I was irreplaceable
We lit the whole world up, before we blew it up,
I still don't know just how we screwed it up
Forever, forever, forever
Love will remember you, love will remember me
I know it inside of my heart,
Forever will forever be ours, even if we try to forget,
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember, love will remember, love'll remember


-The zing-
I thought I found a love, but she was just a fling
And then I met a girl and felt a different thing
It's like you're hit in the ring, like you're pulled by a string
Can't breathe, like you're choking on a chicken wing
It was a thing called a Zing and I wanted to sing
And listen to ballads of the man named Sting
Lady looks in your eyes and it's suddenly spring
Like when Nala looked at Simba in The Lion King
Zinging in the air and I don't have a care
I'm winging from the Zing that we shared
Zinging in the rain, now I'm feeling no pain
It's a real time for celebrating
'Cause you're my Zing
Drac, you ready to throw down?
No, no, I just came closer to, to hear you better
Oh, come on, just give it a try
Allright, maybe just a little
So I listen all you Zingers from here to Beijing
You better crash the box spring, get ready to cling
'Cause if Iove was money, you'd be yelling "cha - ching"
Next to a Zing, cupid's arrow's a little bee sting
It was a Zing and a zang and a zingididi
And there was only one lady in the Zing for me
'Cause when you zing... (When you zing)
You better know one thing
The only thing you're gonna sling is a wedding Ring
Zinging in the air
Now I don't have a care
I'm winging from the Zing that we shared
Zinging in the rain, now I'm feeling no pain
It's a real time for celebrating
'Cause you're my Zing
Feel the Zing, y'all
Ba da bing, y'all
Gonna knock you right out of that ring, y'all
Better bring, y'all
Happening, y'all
Pay attention to the undead king, y'all
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho
Oh, ho, ho, ho
Oh, ho, ho, ho
Oh, ho, ho, ho


-Me and my girls-
Drop down on a desert ride
Just outside the ninety-five
Never felt more, more alive
I got my chicas by my side
If we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
You don't understand
I don't need a man
Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
The night is dark but the moon is bright
We're staring at this summer night
Tan skin looks damn good in white
Stripping down by the Hollywood sign
If we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
You don't understand
I don't need a man
Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's
Me and my girls, me and my girls
You can look, but don't touch
I'm not here to hook up
I'm just here to turn up
Tonight is just us
Me and my girls (tonight)
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls


-Crowded room-
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah
It started polite, out on thin ice
'Til you came over to break it
I threw you a line and you were mine
Yeah, I was afraid, but you made it safe
I guess that is our combination
Said you feel lost, well, so do I
So won't you call me in the morning?
I think that you should call me in the morning
If you feel the same, 'cause
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah
Engulfed in the flames
Engulfed in the shame
Betrayed by your imagination
In over my head, but that's alright
So won't you call me in the morning?
I think that you should call me in the morning
If you feel the same, 'cause
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you
The world keeps on spinning, but I ain't dizzy yet, yeah
The more that you give, give, give, give, the more that you get
It's just us two in the crowd, we feel alone
I turn every chair that you sit in into a throne
Not too many of 'em put it down like me
I say it humbly, but they don't wear the crown like me
It's all in your eyes, locked, loaded, we were rolling
You make the whole room feel slow-motion
You make me feel like I'm drowning in a potion
Closed off, tryna get a little open
The more that I give, the more that I get
So baby, I'ma call you in the AM
You're down for my love, honey, say when
I'll be waitin' on my time 'cause I'm patient
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah


-Shake it up-
Don't like waiting, don't like waiting
Lets go right now
Gotta' hit the ground dancing
Before the music slows down
What I'm saying, what I'm saying
If there's something to fix
Take it to another level
This is the remix
Everybody, everybody
Get out on the floor
It can get a little crazy
When the kick hits the floor
Make a scene, make a scene
Nobody can ignore
Don't knock it, til you rock it
We can't take it no more
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up
DJ set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up
Shake it up
Break it down, break it down
I've got something to say
When you're dancing with me
It's like we go MIA
Make a scene, make a scene
Nobody can ignore
Don't knock it, til you rock it
We can't take…
