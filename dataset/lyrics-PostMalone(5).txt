Half price my whips same price my watch
Got no jumper but I ball a lot
Bitch I'm young stoney, I do what I want
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors of the oo-op drop

Slide boy comin' down, damn I'm hot
Everybody say that I gotta be stopped
Even though my final form ain't unlocked
I'm so ahead of you motherfuckers
How you comprehend what you ain't understanding?
Count a hundred bands and I watch it vanish
Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor
Got a lot of ass, nothing I can't handle
Flavor that's whatever, you should try a sample
Baby I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza
Everybody trying to tell me what I stand for
But you don't fucking know me homie you don't want war
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors of the oo-op drop

Hit the switch open the suicide doors
We already know you vanished though
Hit my momma when I ride in that, oh
All these motherfuckers so false with me
If your money funny, don't talk to me (nah)
I know there ain't shit that you could offer me
Take a second if you think about crossing me
It lasts forever, you should try a sample
Baby I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza
Everybody trying to tell me what I stand for

-Feeling whitney-
I've been looking for some-
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep pouring
And I ain't seen a light of day since, well, that's not important
It's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winning
You knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze
And I'm done
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

I had a really bad feeling you've been lying to me
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see

But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me

But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah (you lied, yeah)
It was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights
9 am, I came from out the club, it was daylight (daylight)
Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice (I was treating her too nice)
Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need (that ain't what I need)
You just sold your soul, girl, quit crying (sold your soul)
From your passport, it looks like you lying (know you cold)
You broken down by your past, don't deny it (you know I know)
Your ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah (flying)

But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Settle down, I spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And caught the girls in your DM's and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out at shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold 15 million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see (but you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (you'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (but you lied, you lied, you lied)

But what's another house to me? (What's that time, yeah)
'Cause I can take anything that you give me (what you give me)
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch
So thank you for the grave (yeah)
I needed me a place to sleep (place to sleep)
We goin', oh


-On the road-
'Cause they ain't never seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
Yeah, they bet I'ma fall
And I'm only 24, but, bitch, I been through it all
I got so many hits, can't remember them all
While I'm takin' a shit, look at the plaques on the wall
Y'all just sit back, get your kickback
Keep on actin' like you did that, got no respect
For nobody who's just fake in life, ayy, ayy
You ain't really who you say you are
So pick up the pace, there ain't no slowin' me up
Get the fuck out my face, can you stop blowing me up?
'Cause my time is expensive, one mil' a setlist
Bought a new car 'fore you walk out for breakfast, yeah
'Cause they ain't never seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
Yeah, where you been? (Where you been?)
When it was time to do some work, and put it in (put it in)
I just be laughin' when I see 'em, look at them (ha)
Leave when I lose, and pop back up as soon as I win (uh)
You ain't my day one, and I know you not my friend
So I can't judge you when you do some phony shit and just pretend
Like you really down with me, because bein' loyal starts within
I seen that money overpower that love, and turn it thin
But it ain't stop me, I just kept goin' up, took it on the chin
I wish every time they said I would fold, I'd make an M
Fuck around and be as rich as Jeff Bezos, say it again
Never lose, I go overtime on 'em, stay in that gym
Let's get it
'Cause they ain't never seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
I'm tired of bein' tired
This my last shot, you can't be mad, at least I tried
We supposed to be grown, but yet you still acting childish
I can get on the jet alone, I don't need no extra baggage
This year turned into a savage, I got baguettes in my necklace
Driving fast and I won't crash it, and I'm supposed to be sober
But some kind of way, I just keep getting loaded
It's gonna take more than some pressure to fold me
Tried as hard as I can, but at this point it's outta my hands
I ain't runnin' out of these bands for nothin' or no one
She say I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one
Been goin' hard, been by myself, I don't need no love
'Cause they ain't never seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
On the road, oh

Dyin' in our sleep, we're living out a dream
We only make it out alone
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
It seem like dying young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out, and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle
Blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go on
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home

Don't you know that I'm more than a come up
You act up and then act like it's nothin'
Sold your soul, you stone cold, you a stunner
Every time you left, shit was never right

See it in your eyes, saw you in the light
Somehow, mami, I still want you
Listen to me, don't drive away (drive away)
Kill me softly, your hold on me is
Somethin' I can't explain
I know you could never be my bitch
Shit could never be like this
I know, stop thinkin' you're in my plans
Hundred times you blew another chance

Then runnin' back to me in the morning
I know shit could never be like this
You could never be my bitch
No, no
Our love will never be another (uh)
You're just a devil undercover (undercover)
Found you when you were in the gutter (in the gutter)
Shit was sweet until I was a sucker ('til I was a sucker)
Rather be single for life (single for life, rather be single)
Then be fuckin' with you
I ain't rollin' the dice, no (rollin' the dice)
I ain't playin' to lose (no)
Everytime you left, shit was never right (no)
In another bed every single night (uh)
Had it to a science, you were so precise
See it in your eyes, saw you in the light
Somehow, mami, I still want you
Listen to me, don't drive away (don't drive away)
Kill me softly, your hold on me is
Somethin' I can't explain
I know you could never be my bitch
Shit could never be like this (be like this)
I know, stop thinkin' you're in my plans
Hundred times you blew another chance (blew another chance)
I know you were gettin' down on the low
Then runnin' back to me in the morning
I know shit could never be like this (be like this)
You could never be my bitch
No, no
Be my bitch
It could never be like this
Shit could never be like this
It could never be like this
