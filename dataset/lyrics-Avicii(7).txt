-Wake me up-
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost


-Waiting for love-
Where there's a will, there's a way, kind of beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around
We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No we can't be defeated
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around


-The nights-
Hey, once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Hey, when face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade
One day my father—he told me,
"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say,
"When you get older
Your wild life will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid."
He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember."
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shinning stars
He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores.
Don't forsake this life of yours.
I'll guide you home no matter where you are."
One day my father—he told me,
"Son, don't let it slip away."
When I was just a kid I heard him say,
"When you get older
Your wild life will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid."
He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember."
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
These are the nights that never die
My father told me


-Hey brother-
Hey brother! There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey sister! Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
Hey brother! Do you still believe in one another?
Hey sister! Do you still believe in love? I wonder
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you out
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
Hey brother! There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey sister! Do you still believe in love? I wonder

Oh brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose it all?

Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do


-Without you-
You said that we would always be
Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free
You
Said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes
Tell me you won't be there
I got to learn how to love without you
I got to carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck I'm going out without you
I'm going to tear this city down without you
I'm going Bonnie and Clyde without you
Now I'm running away my dear
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beating I can't see clear
How I'm wishing that you were here
You
Said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes
Tell me you won't be there
I got to learn how to love without you
I got to carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck I'm going out without you
I'm going to tear this city down without you
I'm going Bonnie and Clyde without you


-Addicted to you-
I don't know just how it happened, I let down my guard
Swore I'd never fall in love again but I fell hard
Guess I should have seen it coming; caught me by surprise
I wasn't looking where I was going; I fell into your eyes
You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing wave
Before I, I knew what hit me, baby, you were flowing though my veins
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
Out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you!
Midnight blows in through the window; dances round the room
Got me hypnotized; I'm getting high on the perfume.
I couldn't live without you now, oh, I know I'd go insane
I wouldn't last one night alone, baby
I couldn't stand the pain!
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
Out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you!


-SOS-
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clean again, I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers
I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go, but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need to now
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

-Lonely together-
Treating you well, but I'm caught in the middle
I caught the edge of the knife and it hurts just a little
Yeah, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that I can't be your friend
It's my head or my heart and I'm caught in the middle
My hands are tied but not tight enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh Lord, here we go
I might hate myself tomorrow but I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of the bottle, you're the poison in the wine
And I know I can't change you and I, I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow but I'm on my way tonight
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Eyes wide shut and it feels like the first time (oh)
Before the rush to my blood hurts too much and we flatline (oh)
Yeah and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends
I'm all messed up and it feels like the first time (oh)
I might free myself tomorrow, but I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of the bottle, you're the poison in the wine
And I know I can't change you and I, I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow, but I'm on my way tonight
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let's be lonely together (yeah)
A little less lonely together (yeah)
My hands are tied but not tight enough

-Heaven-
Step out into the dawn
You pray 'til, you pray 'til the lights come on
And then you feel like you've just been born
Yeah, you come to raise me up
When I'm beaten and broken up
And now I'm back in the arms I love
And I think I just died
I think I just died
Yeah, I think I just died
I think I just died
And went to heaven
And went to heaven
Beaten and bathed in blood
I'm hit by, I'm hit by your love and drug
And now that you've c-come to raise me up
And I think I just died
I think I just died
Yeah, I think I just died
And went to heaven

-I could be the one-
Do you think about me when you're all alone?
The things we used to do, we used to be
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
Do you think about me when the crowd is gone?
It used to be so easy, you and me
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
When you need a way to beat the pressure down
When you need to find a way to breathe
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
If you never see me when the crowd is gone
It used to be so easy, can't you see?
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free


-The days-
Under the tree where the grass don't grow
We made a promise to never get old
You had a chance and you took it on me
And I made a promise that I couldn't keep
Dance play it
'Cause I play it
Play it
Dance play it
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy (play it)
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy(play it)
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy(play it)
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy ('cause I play it)
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy ('cause I play it)
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy ('cause I play it)
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy
Out on the midnight the wild ones howl
The last of the last boys have thrown in the towel
We used to believe we were stars aligned
You made a wish and I fell out of time
Dance play it
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy ('cause I play it)
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy ('cause I play it)
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy ('cause I play it)
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy ('cause I play it)
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy (play it)
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy ('cause I play it)
'Cause I bring it up, oh boy


-For a better day-
Paint on a caution wind
'Neath the bleeding sky
I called your name
There was no one there
And in the cold and snow
I saw your face
And we sang our song for the little thing
Magic calm, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic calm from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day
Straight, from the path of love
In the road of life
I tumble forward
But I'm going on
I'ma keep it strong
I saw your face
And we sang our song for the little thing
Magic calm, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic calm from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day
And we sang our song for the little thing
Magic calm, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic calm from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day


-Broken arrows-
You stripped your love down to the wire
Fire shining cold alone outside
You stripped it right down to the wire
But I see you behind those tired eyes
Now as you wade through the shadows that live in your heart
You'll find the light that leads on
'Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go
'Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose it, sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart
I've seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time
We have to tear down walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go
'Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose it, sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart
Oh
It's not too late, it's not too late
I see the hope in your heart
Sometimes you're losing, sometimes shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
Oh


-Forever yours-
Every time I see your face
There's a cloud hangin' over you
In such a beautiful way
There's a poetry to your solitude
Ooh, you should let me love you
Hold me now, forevermore
Oh, I'll be thinkin' of you
Tell me I'm forever yours
Ooh, you should let me love you
Hold me now, forevermore
Oh, I'll be thinkin' of you
Tell me I'm forever yours
Tell me I'm forever yours
Tell me I'm forever yours
Tell me I'm forever yours
You won't ever have to try
To live by anybody else's rules
It'll be just you and I
Together in the altitude
Ooh, you should let me love you
Hold me now, forevermore
Oh, I'll be thinkin' of you
Tell me I'm forever yours
Ooh, you should let me love you
Hold me now, forevermore
Oh, I'll be thinkin' of you
Tell me I'm forever yours
Tell me I'm forever yours
Tell me I'm forever yours
Tell me I'm forever yours
You should let me love you
Love you
You should let me love you
Love you


-Dear boy-
So bold and fine, I've known you for some time
Whole life changed while bones like yours and mine
Go dance in the woods and down we go, down, down
Oh boy, you're mine, do you remember old times?
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh dear boy, it's so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh, dear boy, it's so shallow without you
It's a chance, boy, everything I ask of you
Sweet love of mine, destruction ain't a crime
For those who find love as a game like you and I
Go dance in the waters of all the tears we have cried
Oh boy, we're fine, do you remember our time?
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh dear boy, it's so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do
Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh, dear boy, it's so shallow without you
It's a chance, boy, everything I ask of you


-Tough love-
Weight is on me, weight is on you
We scream and we fight like there's nothing to lose
End of the day, come and take my arm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Weight is on you, weight is on me
Sometimes I'm not who you want me to be
God knows I try, we stumble and we fall
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Give me tough love and a lesson to learn
Your tough love is what I deserve
Sweet tough love, you're my pretty good luck charm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Weight is on you, weight is on me
Sometimes I'm not who you want me to be
God knows I try, we stumble and we fall
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Give me tough love and a lesson to learn
Your tough love is what I deserve
Sweet tough love, you're my pretty good luck charm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Give me tough love and a lesson to learn
Your tough love is what I deserve
Sweet tough love, you're my pretty good luck charm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms


-Silhouettes-
Press play, fast forward
Nonstop, we have a beaten path before us
It was all there, in plain sight
Come on people, we have all seen the signs
So we will never get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world knew all about us
(We are the future and we're here to stay)
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back
Look back at the faded silhouette
Straight ahead on the path we have before us
Day by day, soon the change will come
Don't you know we took a big step forward
Just lead the way and we pull the trigger
And we will never get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world knew all about us
(We are the future and we're here to stay)
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back
Look back at the faded silhouette


-Heart upon my sleeve-
With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken
Where are you? Where are you?
Oh, now that I need you most and
My heart upon my sleeve, broken down, whoa
I guess I'm just down on my luck a bit, shakin' me out of it
I guess I'm just down on my luck a bit, shakin' me out of it
With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken
Where are you? Where are you?
Oh, now that I need you most and
My heart upon my sleeve, broken down, down, down, down
Now, I can't go a single day without thinking of the words I'd say
And I can't do a single thing without thinking of you, thinking of you
Now I'm just left with the pieces to put back together
(Together, together, together)
(Forever, forever, forever)
With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken
Where are you? Where are you?
Oh, now that I need you most and
My heart upon my sleeve, broken down, down, down, down


-Friend of mine-
Hey
Do you remember we said, "Hello"
And you asked me about my Levi's T-shirt
Said ,"You are a friend of mine"
My, oh my
You must have saved me 'bout a thousand times
I wouldn't be the one I am today
If you hadn't been a friend of mine
I ain't misbehaving, I'm just telling you the truth
Take my love for granted
Yeah, I'd give it all to you
Make me count for something
Yeah, I feel it in my heart
God only knows what I'd have been
If you hadn't been a friend of mine
Hey
I haven't seen around since high school (high school)
How you doing, do you still remember me?
Are you still a friend of mine?
Guess you're still a friend of mine
Guess you're still a friend of mine
Now I see (now I see)
Why I get nervous when you look at me
It's like your eyes are trying to tell me something
That you're more than just a friend of mine
(That you're more than just a friend of mine, oh my)
I ain't misbehaving, I'm just telling you the truth
Take my love for granted
Yeah, I'd give it all to you
Make me count for something
Yeah, I feel it in my heart
God only knows what I'd have been
If you hadn't been a friend of mine


-Fades away-
All of the troubled times that we have overcome
All of the trials to find somewhere that we belong
All I know is that with you I'm holdin' on
'Cause all of the days out, all of the days out on the run
Don't you love it, how it all just fades away?
When you're close, don't fear the songs of yesterday
And I can't go back, and I can't go back
Don't you love it, how it all, it all just fades away?
It all just fades away
All of the tracks we traced, we raced to reach the sun
All of the lights to find the place where we belong
All I know is that with you I'm movin' on
'Cause all of the days out, all of the days out on the run
And I can't go back, and I can't go back
Don't you love it, how it all, it all just fades away?
It all just fades away
It all just fades away
It all just fades away
And I can't go back and I can't go back
Don't you love it, how it all, it all just fades away?


-Feeling good-
Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me, yeah
And I'm feeling good
Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River running free, you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me, yeah
And I'm feeling good

Dragonfly out in the sun
You know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies are havin' fun, you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean
And in this old world is a new world, and a bold world for me!
Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Oh, freedom is mine and I know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

-Taste the feeling-
It feels good, in my heart, in my soul,
When you're right here beside me
I don't ever want this day to end
We can watch the waves, have a Coke
And you sit here beside me
Take a little long my heart again
So we can feel whatever you feel
Together be real, together and
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
You make it easier to sing it
You make it easier to sing it
Feels good as we stand on the shore
And now our hearts are jumping
Grab another Coke and let's dive in
Oh, my love, there's a song in my soul
When you are around me
You make it easier to sing it
So we can feel whatever you feel
Together be real, together at
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
With every fading sunset
We see the stars aligned
We make the simple moments last for a lifetime
So, we can feel forever
You and me, together
We stay free forever
And be real together
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
You make it easier to sing it
You make it easier to sing it


-Sunset jesus-
Tryna set myself up for the win
Some people got a dream that's so much bigger than the town they're in
So give me love, give me love, give me peace, give me peace of mind
I know that there's an ought to a start and I need a little help with mine
California, don't let me down
Seems of golden
But there's struggle all around
Sunset Jesus, came to me
He once was a waiter, now he's a savior making money on the street
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading 'til I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute
I'll be okay
Staring at a billboard from the bus
Looking at the faces, thinking that could be anyone of us
So give me hope, give me hope, give me hope on this lonely ride
'Cause I know one day, I will be the one in the sky
California, don't let me down
Seems of golden
But there's struggle all around
Sunset Jesus, came to me
He once was a waiter, now he's a savior making money on the street
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading 'til I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute
Sunset Jesus
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading 'til I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute
I'll be okay
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading 'til I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute
I'll be okay
