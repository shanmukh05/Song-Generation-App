-She will be loved-
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow I want more
I don't mind spendin' everyday
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full, and my door's always open
You come anytime you want, yeah
I don't mind spendin' everyday
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
I know where you hide alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and makes me catch her every time she falls
Yeah
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I don't mind spendin' everyday
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain, oh

Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

-Payphone-
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone
Man, F that sh--
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take
That little piece of shit with you
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone

-Maps-
I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away?
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you you-you-you-you-you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you you-you-you-you-you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following
Tu bien sabes que yo te ando buscando
Aunque en el tiempo pasó aun yo te sigo amando
Tengo un mapa de papel
Y camino sobre él
Donde estés llegaré
No tienes chance para escaparte
Te sigo buscando por cielo y tierra
Razón de ti nadie me da
Pa' toda mi piel ya no hay mapa
Que me conducirá
Esto parece ficción
Hasta en la televisión
Como entender la canción que estoy haciendo
Para encontrarte
Y yo fui quien te acompañó en la oscuridad
Quien nunca falló. Ehh
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you you-you-you-you-you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you you-you-you-you-you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following
Oh I was there for you
Oh In your darkest times
Oh I was there for you
Oh In your darkest night
Oh I was there for you
Oh In your darkest times
Oh I was there for you
Oh In your darkest night
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you you-you-you-you-you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you you-you-you-you-you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following


-Sunday morning-
Yeah
Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you (someday)
That may be all I'll need (all I need)
In darkness, she is all I see (all I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends
That may be all I'll need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave, yeah
Oh, ah yeah
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you
Find a way to bring myself back home to you
You may not know that may be all I'll need
In darkness, she is all I see (you are all I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning (and I never want to leave)
Driving slow (yeah, yeah, ah, yeah, yeah)
Ah yeah, yeah (all I need)
Ah yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah
There's flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair, oh, oh yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, ah, whoa, oh, yeah whoo


-Harder to breathe-
How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground I'm walking on
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Does it kill
Does it burn
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control
Does it thrill
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe


-Won't go home without you-
I asked her to stay
But she wouldn't listen
And she left before I had the chance to say, oh
The words that would mend
The things that were broken
But now it's far too late; she's gone away
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking: "Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe that
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
The taste of her breath
I'll never get over
The noises that you made kept me awake
Oh
The weight of the things that remained unspoken
Built up so much it crushed us everyday
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking: "Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe that
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Of all the things I felt but never really shown
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go, oh, oh, oh
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh, oh, oh
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you


-Makes me wonder-
I wake up, with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
Feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that
After that
Try to get you back
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye
God damn, my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind; make your move
Forget about the truth
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try (yeah)
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye
I've been here before
One day I'm wake up
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning
Cause
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so this is goodbye
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye
So this is goodbye, yeah
So this is goodbye, yeah
So this is goodbye, yeah


-Wait-
Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no
It's a special occasion
Not invited but I'm glad I made it
Oh, let me apologize
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times
Your love, I don't wanna lose

Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I want to be with you
Can we talk for a moment?
Got these feelings that I'm tired of holding on
Wasn't tryin' to get wasted
I needed more than three or four to say this
Oh, let me apologize (yea)
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times (all those times)
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm begging you

Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I want to be with you
You say I'm just another bad guy
You say I've done a lot of things I can't undo
Before you tell me for the last time
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin' you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I want to be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I want to be with you

-Misery-
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be
And I'll set you free
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me
Oh yeah
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me
Oh yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show
So let me be
I'll set you free
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me
Oh yeah
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me
Oh yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
You say your faith is shaken
And you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
I'm getting near, I don't care where I have to run
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah
I am in misery

-Love somebody-
I know your insides are feeling so hollow
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow, yeah
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you can take me all the way, if you take me all the way

-Cold-
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold
Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?
Distant when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so...
Cold enough to chill my bones?
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold
Why you're so
Why you're so
I don't understand why you're so
Why you're so
Why you're so
I don't understand why you're so cold
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?
Distant, oh, when we're kissing, yeah
Feel so different, yeah.
Baby, tell me how did you get so...
Cold enough to chill my bones?
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold
Why you're so
Why you're so
I don't understand why you're so
Why you're so
Why you're so
I don't understand why you're so cold
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryin'a cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay, and I leave
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word
But the four letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, but where your heart used to be
You gold dig every day
I switched the four door to the two door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so
Cold enough to chill my bones?
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold


-Lips on you-
You keep me connected to you
Like I was your shadow
You're givin' me answers
To all of my questions
Here on my pillow, oh
Can't nothing get in between us, baby
We've been waiting on this moment for so long
You wanna be reckless, restless
Right until tomorrow
Wait
When I put my lips on you
You feel the shivers go up and down
Your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby cry for me
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
When I put my lips on you (when I, when I, when I)
Just turn off the lights
And you could be my private dancer
When we close the curtains
You and me can forget all our manners
The neighbors must think we're crazy, baby
'Cause look how easily we keep coming undone
You wanna be reckless, restless
Right until tomorrow
Wait
When I put my lips on you
You feel the shivers go up and down
Your spine for me
Make you cry for me
When I put my lips on you
I hear your voice echoing all through the night for me
Baby cry for me

-Daylight-
Here I am waiting, I'll have to leave soon
Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come, we knew it all along
How did it come so fast?
This is our last night but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know, when I wake
I will have to slip away
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Here I am staring at your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright, the stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down
This is way too hard
'Cause I know, when the sun comes up
I will leave, this is my last glance
That will soon be memory
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
I never wanted to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark
But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close

-Never gonna leave this bed-
You push me, I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
So take me down
Take me down
You hurt me, but do I deserve this
You make me so nervous
Calm me down
Calm me down
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
So come here and never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down
Slows me down
So fall down I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out why don't you help me out
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
You say go
It isn't working and I say no
It isn't perfect so I'll stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed
Take it, take it all take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back
And fake it, fake it I'll take what I can get
Knocking so loud, can you hear me yet?
Try to stay awake but you can't forget
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
Oh, you say go
It isn't working and I say no
It isn't perfect so I'll stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed
Take it, take it all take all that I have
Take it, take it all take all that I have


-If i never see you face again-
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn, you're not the only one
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun
Now you've gone somewhere else, far away
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath, on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you)
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight
Sometimes you move so well
It's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell
Where you end and I begin
It makes you burn to learn
I'm with another man
I wonder if he's half
The lover that I am
Now you've gone somewhere else, far away
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath, On your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you)
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight
Baby, baby, please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind
(Promise not to leave me behind)
Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time
(Talk to me, talk to me)
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight


-This love-
I was so high, I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore, woah, woah, woah
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But, oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore woah, woah, woah
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything is alright
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
My heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore


-Lucky strike-
You're such a motivator, I gotta get you here
So sick of saying yes sir, yes sir
You're such an instigator, you wanna play the game
Take it or leave it, that's her, that's her
And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
You're body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike
Stuck in her elevator, she take me to the sky
And I don't wanna go down, go down
She said I'll feel you later, go ahead and fantasize
She'll make me want her right now, right now
And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
You're body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike
My lucky strike, my lucky strike
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million


-This Summer's Gonna Hurt Like a Motherfucker-
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it
I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular, oh
This summer's gonna hurt
It's gonna hurt
I see her dancing in the street
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
'Cause she's so fancy
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker


-Wakeup call-
I didn't hear what you were saying
I live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions, never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So, who the hell are you to save me?
I never would have made it, babe
If you needed love
Well, then, ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
'Cause you both deserve
What's coming now
So don't say a word
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me?
I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here?
I don't think so
Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I'm finally sleeping soundly
And your lover's screaming loudly
I hear a sound and hit the ground
If you needed love
Well, then, ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
'Cause you both deserve
What's coming now
So don't say a word
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me?
I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here?
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I'm so sorry, darling
Did I do the wrong thing?
Oh, what was I thinking?
Is his heart still beating?
Whoa, oh, oh
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me?
I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here?
I don't feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me?
I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore, no
He won't come around here?
I don't feel so bad


-Must get out-
I've been the needle and the thread
Weaving figure eights and circles around your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said
Fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing till dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
"This is not goodbye, " she said
"It's just time for me to rest my head"
She does not walk, she runs instead
Down these jagged streets and into my bed
When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing till dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
There's only so much I can do for you
After all of the things you've put me through
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing till dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing till dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
I'm lifting you up (oh oh)
I'm letting you down (oh oh)
I'm dancing till dawn (oh oh)
I'm fooling around (oh oh)
I'm not giving up (oh oh)
I'm making your love (oh oh)
This city's made us crazy and we must get out (oh oh)


-Sweetest goodbye-
Uh
Uh, huh
Yeah, yeah
Uh
Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms open hearts
And if it never ends then when do we start?
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand, oh whoah
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you comeback
I have something to say, yeah
How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home, home
There must be some place here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I
Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
And I know you'll understand, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you comeback
I have something to say, yeah
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home, home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel
Feel
Feel
Feel
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pushing forward and arching back (yeah, oh)
Bring me closer to heart attack
How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home, home
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel (show you how I feel, show you how I feel)
Show you how, show you, show
Show you how I feel
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel (show you, show you, show you, show you, show)


-It was always you-
Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling, oh
All day long my heart was beating
Searching for the meaning, oh
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind
We were just wasting time, uh uh babe
For my whole life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind, but now I realize
It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time
All this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied
Satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you
Always you
All my hidden desires
Finally came alive, hmm
No, I never told lies
To you so why would I
Start tonight
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind
We were just wasting time, uh uh yeah
For my whole life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind, but now I realize
It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time
All this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied
Satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you
Always you
Ah, yeah (you, you, you, always you, you, you)
Ah, yeah (you, you, you, always you, you, you)
Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling
It was always you
Even if I could not see it all this time
All this time
It was always you (always)
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you, always you
It was always you
