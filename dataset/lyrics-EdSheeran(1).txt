-Shape of you-
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you


-Perfect-
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in
And follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
Darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, we're listenin' to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
Oh, no, no
Mm
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, we're listenin' to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
No, I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight


-Thinking out loud-
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh
So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are (maybe)
And we found love right where we are


-Photograph-
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Love can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier,
Remember that with every piece of you
Hm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
You can fit me inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone,
"Wait for me to come home"


-Castle on the hill-
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me and I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill


-Beautiful people-
We are, we are, we are
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown
('Round here) everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and

We don't fit in well

Flawless diamonds

Drop a album, drop a baby, but I never drop the ball, uh
So join me in this bed (this bed) that I'm in (that I'm in)

-I see fire-
Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons
If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out for the rope
Stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on
The mountain side, hey
And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out for the rope
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn on and on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
And I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
Oh, should my people fall
Then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out for the rope
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
And I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns
Then my brothers will die
And as the sky is falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out
Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
I see fire
Oh you know I saw a city burning out (fire)
And I see fire
Feel the heat upon my skin, yeah (fire)
And I see fire (fire)
And I see fire burn on and on the mountain side


-Dive-
Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Oh, baby I apologize for it
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
You're a mystery
I have traveled the world, there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history? (what's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mhm
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, everyday don't know how much I can take
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at every mess that I made
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
Let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you


-Don't-
Hit the corner, burnin' rubber like a stunt driver
Burning marijuana, bitch, I'm a bit liver
Gotta keep a bitch in check, microphone check
Killed your boy's career, still no arrest yet
Snow white yacht in my red Yeezys
Ed Sheeran got the city streets tweakin'
On a back block you may catch the boss
M-cig, love to vape so we liftin' off
With a weapon, go to steppin' like I'm Kevin Spacey
No prom date, women they would love to hate me
It's such a pretty thing, life is such a bitch
Went to sleep as friends, waking up to this
See it my way or see me at the top
Built an empire, bitch, off a nickel rock
Microphone check, microphone check
We came to party, smoke until there's nothing left
I met this girl late last year
She said "don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later and returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, but guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe


-Supermarket flowers-
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearin' me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holdin' me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holdin' me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, "Hallelujah, you're home"


-Happier-
Walking down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're movin' on with someone new
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle
And telling myself you're happier, aren't you?
(Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah)
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you (hey, yeah, hey, yeah)
But ain't nobody need you like I do (hey, yeah, hey, yeah)
I know that there's others that deserve you (hey, yeah, hey, yeah)
But my darlin', I am still in love with you
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
'Cause baby, you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waitin' here for you


-Take me back to london-

I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault (oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (whoa)
He said, "Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown"
I've been away for a while, traveled a billion miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now
Jet plane headed up to the sky (to the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (woo, woo)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (in a what?)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle night, ceilin' low (ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (when in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (they don't)
So take me back to London
Yo (woo!)
When I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalt and Vibranium
I got an RM11, titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily
But I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags rippin' off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, "That's just the way things go"
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Baddingham pub
I told Stormz, two years, youu'll be wrapping it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITS (it don't stop)
And you can do Glasto' (headline slot)
But when you're miles away and you're feeling alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home
Jet plane headed up to the sky (to the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, gettin' high (getting high)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (in a what?)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle night, ceilin' low (ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (when in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (like my home)
So take me back to London
So take me back to London


-The A team-
White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the class A Team
She's stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to her
'Cause she's just under the upper-hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
'Cause in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
Angels to fly
Angels to fly, mm
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed and dry throat
Call girl, no phone
They say
She's in the class A Team
She's stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause she's just under the upper-hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
'Cause in the pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
Angels to fly
Now an angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, now we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
Just straight down the line, oh, mm
Now they say
She's in the class A Team
She's stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
When we're all under the upper-hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
'Cause in the pipe we'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
Angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
Angels to fly, to fly, to fly
Angels to die


-Lego house-
I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a Lego house
When things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind, it's all for you
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got ya to keep me warm
And if you're broken I'll mend ya
And I keep you sheltered from the storm
That's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now, now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers and color you in
If things go right we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got ya to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend ya
And I keep you sheltered from the storm
That's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I will love you better now


-Galway girl-
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me, "What does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?"
Said, "It was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?"
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding as shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played her fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
With my pretty little Galway girl
You're my pretty little Galway girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Kaleigh, singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
You know, she played her fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home, then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway girl and a perfect night
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway girl, hey


-How would you feel-
You are the one girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you
We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in the front yard
We got questions we should not ask but
How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
In the summer, as the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you
We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms round you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon
How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in the front yard

-Put it all on me-
Ooh, I can't wait to get home
I don't know why, but I'm feelin' low
Happened again and I want you to know
Having my woman there is good for my soul
I try to be strong, well, I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love
It's you and only you
Who can be takin' away
The shit that I go through
Each and everyday
When I'm alone with you
You make it better again, yeah
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Catch my eye, and she starts to say
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
My darlin', I'll be all you need (you need)
I know it hasn't been your day, your week, your week, your week
So put it all on me (woo)
Oh my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge me 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me
All on me, on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
All on me, on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
All on me, on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whenever you need
To put it all on me
Ooh, you're there for me when I
Need you to be, 'cause I
Find it hard to say the words
But some shit don't need an explanation, baby
I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love
It's you and only you
That can be takin' away
The shit that I go through
Each and everyday
Baby, I can't wait
In love with all your ways
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Grab my waist when I start to say, now
Hey baby, we can dance slowly (hey)

-All of the stars-
It's just another night
And I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star
And thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here,
I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
I can see the stars
From America
I wonder, do you see them, too?
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
They're playing 'Chasing Cars'
And I thought of us
Back to the time,
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp lit streets I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars?
Over Amsterdam
You're the song my heart is
Beating to
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
And, oh, I know
And oh, I know, oh
I can see the stars
From America


-Best part of me-
My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and fallin' out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight day-to-day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell d'you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself
Baby, the best part of me is you
Lately, everything's makin' sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you
I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time, always thirty minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah
He loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself
'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Whoa, lately, everything's makin' sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you
With you
Baby, the best part of me is you
Whoa, lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you, oh
Baby, I'm so in love with you, yeah, yeah
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you


-Make it rain-
When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though
I know this fire brings me pain
Even so
And just the same
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Oh make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Make it rain
The seed needs the water
Before it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
And the hunger more profound
Well I know there can come tears from the eye
But they may as well be in vain
Even though
I know these tears come with pain
Even so
And just the same
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Oh make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain
And the seas are full of water
That stops by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur, oh no no
Never reach the port
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
That fill the sky
With all that they can drop
When it's time to make a change
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Oh make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Oh make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh make it rain


-Blood stream-
I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in
I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
Calling out across the line (brokenhearted)
So tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted


-You need me, i don't need you-
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you at all
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verso
Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer. You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
'A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi'
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me
'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on arabian nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when I'm singing them out (wow)
From day one, I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
'Cause it's another day plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors
Nationwide til' we're just jack, soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a French church tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you


-Kiss me-
Settle down with me
Cover me up
Cuddle me in
Lie down with me
And hold me in your arms
And your heart's against my chest, your lips pressed in my neck
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love
Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms
Oh no
My heart's against your chest, your lips pressed in my neck
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet
And with this feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love
Yeah I've been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you
So I hold you close to help you give it up
So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love


-One-
Tell me that you'll turned down the man
Who asks for your hand
'Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me, ooh
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if, we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh Lord now
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong?
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one


-Sing-
It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time lady
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know, oh, oh, ooh ooh
Oh, oh, ooh ooh
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe, oh, oh, ooh ooh
Oh, oh, ooh ooh
Sing! (Oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
(Oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Louder! (Oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Sing! (Oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' "We Found Love" in a local rave, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name, then said "It's nice to meet you"
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now not
Soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another now she's kissing my mouth
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know, oh, oh, ooh ooh
Oh, oh, ooh ooh
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe, oh, oh, ooh ooh
Oh, oh, ooh ooh
Sing! (Oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
(Oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Louder! (Oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Sing! (Oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't really wanna dance
But can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so hoped you'd take my hand, darling
Before the beats kicks in again
But can you feel it?
Ooh oh-oh
Can you feel it?
Oh no no no?
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling (oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Won't you let me know oh, oh, ooh ooh (louder!) (oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Oh, oh, ooh ooh (oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
(Sing!) If you love me come on get involved (oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe (oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Oh, oh, ooh ooh (louder!) (oh, oh oh ooh oh oh oh)
Oh, oh, ooh ooh
Sing!


-Tenerife sea-
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love
Lumiere, darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere, darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere, darling
Lumiere over me
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
So in love
So in love
So in love, love, love, love
So in love
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you, Beth
